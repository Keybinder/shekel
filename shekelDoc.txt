Shekel Documentation

Basic Information
There are 2 different board representations that the base program deals with: 3-bit binary and characters.
The character representation is used in saving and loading files and all other internal operations are performed with the binary pieces.
The first two bits in the binary represent the type of piece (00 - empty square, 01 - shekel, 10 - whekel, 11 - fisher)



REFERENCES FOR LATER
Functions that take mtuple (i.e. move, board, turn) as any one parameter:
  is_legal_move
  move_piece
Functions that take btuple (i.e board, turn) as any one parameter:
  check_captures
  save_board
Functions that take neither:
  parse_move
  load_board

turn is 0 if white's turn, 1 if black's turn
similarly, colour is 0 if white, 1 if black

Any board load files should be comprised of 9 lines
first 8 should be 7 characters long
last line should contain either 0 or 1 to represent the turn
