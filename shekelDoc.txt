Basic Information
There are 2 different board representations that the base program deals with: 3-bit binary and characters.
The character representation is used in saving and loading files and all other internal operations are performed with the binary pieces.
The first two bits in the binary represent the type of piece (00 - empty square, 01 - shekel, 10 - whekel, 11 - fisher)
